# Guess Game

A small, simple Python number-guessing game.

This repository contains a tiny command-line game (`guess_game.py`) where the player tries to guess a randomly chosen number. It's intended as a learning/example project for beginners exploring Python basics like input/output, random numbers, and control flow.

## Features
- Single-file, zero-dependency Python script
- Interactive command-line play

## How to run
From PowerShell in the repository folder:

```powershell
python .\guess_game.py
```

If your system uses `python3`:

```powershell
python3 .\guess_game.py
```

## Files
